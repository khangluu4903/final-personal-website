    "text": "Amazon Sales Data Statistical Modeling Competition\n\nDeveloped and optimized ML regression models to predict total sales from a dataset with 34 variables and 5894 rows.\nUtilized tidymodels and tidyverse for preprocessing, including scaling 13 predictors, which reduced RMSE by 0.09%, and hyperparameter tuning 7 random forest and linear regression models on training data with 2942 observations.\nAchieved 95.82% accuracy on test data with the top-performing random forest model, placing 3th out of 16 teams.\n\nCalifornia Housing Price Prediction\n\nUtilized pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn for data manipulation, visualization, and exploration.\nConducted data exploration and transformation, including log transformations of skewed variables to achieve a normal distribution.\nEmployed scikit-learn for splitting the data into training and testing sets, as well as for fitting the linear multiple regression model.\nUtilized statsmodels for additional statistical analysis, including checking coefficients, p-values, and model summary statistics.\nAchieved R-squared value of 0.686, indicating the model explains about 68.6% of the variation in housing prices.\n\nTelco Customer Churn\n\nExplored the datasetâ€™s shape and information to understand its structure. Checked for missing values and converted columns to the correct data types. Used pandas to handle data.\nCalculated the overall churn rate and visualized it using a bar chart. Analyzed churn rates based on customer tenure, finding a significant decrease in churn as tenure increases. Used matplotlib for visualization.\nBuilt a linear regression model to predict churn rate based on tenure. The model showed a strong correlation (R-squared value of 0.83) between tenure and churn rate. Used scipy.stats for the linear regression analysis.\nAnalyzed churn rates for different Telco services like Phone Service, Online Security, and Streaming TV. Identified services with higher churn rates, providing insights for targeted improvements.\nInvestigated churn rates for customers using multiple Telco services. Found that customers with 2 services had the highest churn rate, suggesting a need for bundled service offerings or enhanced retention strategies.\nProvided actionable recommendations for Telco, such as focusing on new customers for retention efforts, improving services with high churn rates, and promoting bundled service offerings based on the analysis."
