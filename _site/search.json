Checked for missing values and converted columns to the correct data types. Used pandas to handle data.\nCalculated the overall churn rate and visualized it using a bar chart. Analyzed churn rates based on customer tenure, finding a significant decrease in churn as tenure increases. Used matplotlib for visualization.\nBuilt a linear regression model to predict churn rate based on tenure. The model showed a strong correlation (R-squared value of 0.83) between tenure and churn rate. Used scipy.stats for the linear regression analysis.\nAnalyzed churn rates for different Telco services like Phone Service, Online Security, and Streaming TV. Identified services with higher churn rates, providing insights for targeted improvements.\nInvestigated churn rates for customers using multiple Telco services. Found that customers with 2 services had the highest churn rate, suggesting a need for bundled service offerings or enhanced retention strategies.\nProvided actionable recommendations for Telco, such as focusing on new customers for retention efforts, improving services with high churn rates, and promoting bundled service offerings based on the analysis."
